# Smart-Traffic-Management-System

- Developed a deep learning-based traffic prediction model using PyTorch
and OpenCV
- Deployed the model on a cloud-based platform to predict traffic
congestion and optimize traffic signal control
- Collaborated with a team of 3 engineers to integrate the model with
existing traffic management systems
- Achieved an accuracy of 92% in predicting traffic congestion
